                    <p>Medication errors are among the leading causes of preventable harm in healthcare. From missed doses to dangerous drug interactions, these errors often stem from challenges in medication management. Thatâ€™s why we created MediTracker, a medication tracker designed to prioritize patient safety and put users in control of their health.</p>
